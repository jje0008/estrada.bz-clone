the House of Estrada, at Martimporra (Bimenes)</P>
<P ALIGN="left"></FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style">There is
no exact data on the date of the construction of the palace, but it
can be said that it dates from the end of the XVII Century, maybe
close to the 1700s. The chapel, consecrated to the Virgin of the Road
(to Santiago), dates from an earlier time, maybe twenty or thirty
years before.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The palace was founded by Juan de Valvidares and
his wife, Cecilia Estrada. Both their families were the greatest
landowners of the region at the time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The coat-of-arms that presides over the front of
the palace is one of alliance of the surnames of Cecilia Estrada's
parents, don Bernardo de Estrada y Nava, of Bimenes, and doña María
Fernández de la Rosella, of Langreo. The individual coats of arms are
described, from a heraldic point of view, in tha following way:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The eagle that dominates the Estrada coat-of-arms
is the eagle that represents the German empire. The right of its use
was granted, in 1188, to Gonzalo Fernández de Estrada by the Emperor
Frederick of Germany, after being present at the marriage ceremonies
of Conrad, Frederick's son, with doña Berenguela, daughter of King
Alfonso VIII of Castille.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The surname Estrada, of which one of the branches
of settled in what is now the Council of Bimenes, has its origin in a
locality close to San Vicente de la Barquera, which in those times was
part of Asturias, more concretely to what was known as &quot;The
Asturias of Santillana&quot; or what is the same, &quot;The mountains
of Santillana&quot;. The surname as &quot;way&quot; or
&quot;road&quot; is probably derived from what was the road par
exellence at the time, &quot;The Road to Santiago&quot;, one of the
main roads travelled by the faithful in their pilgrimage to the tomb
of the Apostle Saint James, in Santiago de Compostella, in Galicia.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The word estrada is derived from the latin strata
and is in active use, with some evolutive changes, in many languages
with latin roots, including Spanish. It is the equivalent of
&quot;road&quot; and this equivalency is maintained in the chapel of
the Estradas, dedicated to &quot;The Virgin of the Road&quot;.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of doña Cecilia's brothers, don Gerónimo de
Estrada Fernández de la Rosella y Nava received a commission from His
Majesty King Phillip V of Spain, to perform certain services to the
Crown in New Granada, what is now Colombia. At the end of his commission, don
Gerónimo was rewarded with the title of Marquis of the House of
Estrada, which was granted on the 13 of October, 1704. He married
doña Juana de Angulo, natural of Cartagena de Indias and when he
returned from overseas he fixed his residence in Cádiz. He continued
his life in Andalucía where his descendants still live. However,
apparently it was his wish that, upon his death, he be buried in the
land of his birth, and following those wishes his remains now rest
under the main altar of the Chapel of the Virgin of the Road, beside
the palace. In two tombstones that evoque his memory at each side of
the altar, one can read the family motto: &quot;This is the House of
Estrada / founded on this rocky outcrop / older than Velasco / and to
the king I owe nothing&quot;.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His son, Diego de Estrada y Angulo, maried in 1712
to María Panés Viganiego, of genovese ascendancy and related to the Marquis of Villapanés, title that was inherited by his great
grandson Juan de Dios de Estrada y Villalón, born in 1773. The son of
this last one, Juan Antonio de Estrada y González de Sepúlveda,
inherited the title of Marquis of Torreblanca of Aljarafe and was
named Grandee of Spain (the equivalent of a peer) in 1865.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The palace and the chapel of the Marquis of Casa
Estrada at Martimporra, as well as the farms that made up the
property, belonged to that Andalusian branch of the family until they
were purchased, in 1919, by those who were at the time the
administrators of the property, don Arturo Ordóñez Vigil and doña
Carmen Redondo Castañón, parents of the present owner and
descendants of the family Valvidares - whom, as we have seen, were,
along with the Estradas, the founders of the palace. The Estrada,
Valvidares and Vigil families were of notable historical importance in
the Council of Bimenes.</FONT><!--mstheme--></font></TD>
