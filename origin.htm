   Estrada is a toponimic surname, which means it derives from a place, being

   <P STYLE="margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 1"><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">The
   information on the origins of the surname <I>ESTRADA</I> comes from

   Alberto and Arturo García Carraffa; the <I>
   Nobiliary</I> <I>Dictionary</I> by Julio de Atienza; the Nobiliary
   of the Kingdoms and Fiefdoms of Spain, by don Francisco Piferrer;
   and, the Historical, Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary by don Luis Vilar y

   <P STYLE="margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 1"><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">The
   Encyclopædia and the Dictionary by the brothers García Carraffa
   is a monumental work that contains rich and well documented
   information. They studied and analyzed the works of Barahona,
   Alonso de Santa Cruz, Miguel Salazar and others. With such
   precedents and ample criteria, the brothers García Carraffa were
   able to establish the real historical fundamentals of the surnames
   in their works and were able to disprove the fables created by some
   genealogists, no doubt with the object of pleasing the powerful
   members of some lineages. Among these surnames is Estrada.</FONT></B>
   <P STYLE="margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 1"><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">The
   genealogist Sota,
   although of greater antiquity than the García Carraffas,&nbsp; sinthesizes
   very well the outlook applied by them in the case of Estrada: </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4"><I>&quot;Those
   of Estrada should understand that having such high and certain
   origin in their own land, they should not be deceived into looking
   for that which is uncertain and fabulous in a foreign one&quot;</I>.</FONT></B>
   <P STYLE="margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 1"><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Among
   the fables that were created was that of descendancy from Count
   Gótico or Gotos of Germany, suposedly a son of the Duke of Saxony
   and grandson of Emperor Otto of the Roman Empire,
   because of which a German origin was attributed to the surname.
   Another story, related to the same Count, tells of his marriage to doña
   Palla or Pelaya as the matriarch and origin of the surname. Yet another
   fable related to the same Count Gótico links the surname to the French Duke of Estralén, by which
   an etymological link was established between estralén, which is
   French, with estrada, which is Spanish, without having any relationship at all and disavowing the very clear origin of the
   word estrada and its meaning. All the fables were discarded by
   methodical historical and genealogical analisys.</FONT></B>
   <P STYLE="margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 1"><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Luis
   Vilar y Pascual has this to say as to the nation of origin of the

   </FONT> <I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">&quot;The Estrada family is, without
   contest, one of oldest splendor, not only in Asturias but in all of
   Spain, and those who write of it confused in their principles and

order of the surnames</B></FONT>.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One of the greatest causes of
confusion in genealogy stems from the different ways in which people
of different cultures use their given names and surnames. When
surnames were first used, there was no set standard as to order of
usage, so many lineages carry that of the female line as the family
surname.&nbsp;<BR>
In some cases, similar to the Nordic usage, the father´s name bacame
a part of the surname, as in the case of Gonzalo Fernández de Estrada
(son of Fernando). His son would be X Gonzales de Estrada (son of
Gonzalo).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In Spain, origin of our surname, the
present usage is: Given names, father's surname and, at last, mother's maiden
surname. The woman usually does not lose her surname upon marriage but
adds her husband's after her own father's surname, preceeded by
&quot;de&quot;, meaning &quot;of&quot; in a sense of belonging to.<BR>
Spanish genealogists at present use a standard that follows one of these orders: Father's
surname, mother's maiden surname and at last, the given names.&nbsp;
Some omit the mother's maiden surname. Others follow this order:
Father's surname, given name and middle name.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the USA and other English speaking
countries, the usage is variable, therefore causing much confusion.
The given name always occupy the first places, but the
surnames don't follow a standard patern. Sometimes the middle name is
a surname, either the father's or the mother's and sometimes it's one of the given names. The last name is usually the father's
surname, but not always, as some use the mother's maiden surname as
the last name. Some don't use the father's surname at all, but use the
mother's as the family name, and viceversa.<BR>
All this makes it very difficult to follow male or female family
lines, as there is no certainty as to the gender of who gave the family
its surname.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To make matters worse, in some
countries, like those in Scandinavia, there are no family surnames, just
given names and a reference to being son or daughter of a certain
individual, known also by his/her given name and that of his/her
father's.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In this Web site we respect the usage
of each individual in the case of English speaking members. In the
case of those who follow the Spanish usage, after the given names we
have the father's surname, a hyphen and the mother's maiden surname,
without separation.&nbsp; Some individuals have only one surname, as
some years ago only one was used. The use of the hyphen is not to
create composed surnames; it only responds to the way the software we
use works. If the hyphen was not used, the mother's surname would be
the family name.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The usage of both surnames in a
specific order makes it easier to identify family lines.</FONT><!--mstheme--></font></TD>
